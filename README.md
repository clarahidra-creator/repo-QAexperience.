# QA & Data Validation Automation

## Overview
This repository showcases my professional experience as a **QA Engineer** with a strong focus on **ETL data validation, automation testing, and AI-driven workflows**.  
It includes automated test cases, ETL validation scripts, and examples of integrating QA practices into data pipelines to ensure **data quality, accuracy, and reliability**.  

The goal is to demonstrate hands-on skills in:
- Manual & automated QA for web, APIs, and data systems.  
- ETL testing for large-scale data pipelines.  
- AI-assisted validation (Airtable + Make + OCR integrations).  
- Reporting and CI/CD integration.
